                A soccer table ranks teams in the league according to the number of points that they earn from each league
                match they play. The higher the number of points a team has, the higher they will be in the table.

                    Teams are awarded points based on the result of each match: 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. 
                    The total number of points a team has is based on the number of games they have won or drawn. The higher 
                    number of points they have, the higher the team will be in the league table.
