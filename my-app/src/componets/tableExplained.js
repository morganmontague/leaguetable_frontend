                A soccer table ranks teams in the league according to the number of points that they earn from each league
                match they play. The higher the number of points a team has, the higher they will be in the table.

                <div>
                    Teams are awarded points based on the result of each match: 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. 
                    The total number of points a team has is based on the number of games they have won or drawn. The higher 
                    number of points they have, the higher the team will be in the league table.

                    What happens if two teams have the same amount of points?

                <div>
                    If two or more teams have the same amount of points, other methods are used to determine the outcome. The most common is 
                    goal differential, and it is calculated as the number of goals scored in all league matches minus the number of goals conceded.
                    The 2022 World Cup has added another layer to this for the times where even goal differential is even. The world cup implimented counting yellow cards as the tie breaker.
